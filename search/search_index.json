For other uses, see DEI (disambiguation).</p> <p></p> <p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are organizational frameworks which seek to promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination on the basis of identity or disability.[^1] These three notions (diversity, equity, and inclusion) together represent \"three closely linked values\" which organizations seek to institutionalize through DEI frameworks.[^2] Some experts say diversity and inclusion should be decoupled in some cases.[^3] Some frameworks, primarily in Britain, substitute the notion of \"equity\" with equality: equality, diversity, inclusion (EDI).^4[^6] Other variations include diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB),^7[^9] justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI or EDIJ),^10 or diversity, equity, inclusion and access (IDEA, DEIA or DEAI).^12[^14]</p> <p>Diversity refers to the presence of variety within the organizational workforce, such as in identity and identity politics. It includes gender, culture, ethnicity, religion, disability, class, age or opinion.^2 Equity refers to concepts of fairness and justice, such as fair compensation and substantive equality.[^15] More specifically, equity usually also includes a focus on societal disparities and allocating resources and \"decision making authority to groups that have historically been disadvantaged\",[16] and taking \"into consideration a person's unique circumstances, adjusting treatment accordingly so that the end result is equal.\"[2] Finally, inclusion refers to creating an organizational culture that creates an experience where \"all employees feel their voices will be heard\",[2] and a sense of belonging and integration.15</p> <p>DEI is most often used to describe certain \"training\" efforts, such as diversity training. Though DEI is best known as a form of corporate training, it also finds implementation within many types of organizations, such as within academia, schools, and hospitals.18</p> <p>In recent years, DEI efforts and policies have generated criticism, some directed at the specific effectiveness of its tools, such as diversity training, its effect on free speech and academic freedom, as well as more broadly attracting criticism on political or philosophical grounds.</p>"}]}
